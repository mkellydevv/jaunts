If you are entering on foot, horse, or bike the fee is per person. You can also purchase a park-specific annual pass. Please check with the park for current rates.\n\nThis hike, although challenging, is one of the most popular hikes in Shenandoah National Park. It has been referred to as a \u201cbrutally awesome\u201d hike by many. Your climb to the peak includes many rocky switchbacks, so you will not be going straight up, but the trails are still at a steep grade. The descent, which will be slightly longer than your ascent, is a much more gradual grade that ends on a fire trail.\n\nTo start, this hike begins with a one-mile walk up the road to the original Old Rag parking area. Turn left onto the Ridge Trail and begin your approximate two mile ascent along switchbacks before reaching the boulder scramble section. There are handwritten numbers below the blue trail blazes throughout the trail. You\u2019ll be going up, down, in between, around, and underneath granite boulders throughout the scramble. While going through the rock scrambling, keep your eyes open for the blue blazes, as sometimes they are in strange places.\n\nThroughout your journey to Old Rag Mountain, each time you think you\u2019ve reached the summit \u2013 you haven\u2019t! This mountain has several false summits. You\u2019ll know that you\u2019ve reached the Old Rag Summit when you see the brown \u2018Old Rag Mountain\u2019 sign. Find a lovely rock with a fabulous 360 degree view for your lunch spot here before starting your descent back down by way of the Saddle Trail.\n\nRock hopping down, you\u2019ll pass two shelters. First is the Byrds Nest Shelter, then the Old Rag Shelter (privy here) before hitting a junction. Stay to your right to continue back on the Weakley Hollow Fire Road for about four miles to return to the parking lot. You will pass through beautiful forests and see Brokenback Run that leads into the Hughes River.\n\nThis is a challenging hike that will take most users several hours. It is highly recommended that you bring plenty of water on your trip. Hiking Old Rag is an adventure that should be on every Virginia hiker\u2019s bucket list.", "tips": "This is a very challenging hike. Do not attempt this hike unless you are fully prepared.

It is an amazing experience to hike it but it is challenging the ENTIRE time (except maybe like 2 miles on the fire road on the way back.)\n\nThe scramble: I am 5\u20193\u201d and I needed a friend to actually give me multiple boosts during the rock scramble. It\u2019s not short-queen friendly, but there were also time\u2019s when the guys I was with were in pretty tight pickles and I had to help them navigate time things bc I could carry their packs more easily. Unless you are EXTREMELY  skilled I would absolutely do this with a few friends. \n\nOne thing to be aware of - when you start your descent be super careful. It\u2019s still very rocky and it would be very easy to turn an ankle if you are not nimble. Just something to be mentally prepared for. \n\nOtherwise a this is an amazing hike with a few very difficult parts and you will feel like you won the Olympics when you finish. \n\nWe got there at 6:45 am on a Friday and it was not crowded.

The views from the summit are good but it is the scramble to the top that is the highlight.", "This is a very strenuous hike in the July heat. We started early at 6:30 AM and finished the hike by around noon. Both I and my wife are moderately fit hikers but I ended up having sore ankles at the end of it (first time ever that my ankles have been sore). I recommend carrying at least 2.5 l of water per person and perhaps 3 l if one is starting the hike later in the day. Rock scrambles were indeed tough but enjoyable. ", "This was she best hike I\u2019ve ever done. I am very fit and there were a lot of spots even I was struggling. It isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. Pack lots of water. New bigger parking lot so there are way more spots then before.", "Old Rag has been on the list for years. I finally had the chance to do it and am so glad I did. It was strenuous in some ways. I am in moderately good shape, strength training twice a week and I trail run. I still found the rock scrambles on the Ridge Trail challenging but doable. I was grateful other people were around and offered to assist if I needed it (which thankfully I didn't need). The Saddle Trail back down was steep but easy going and the fire road fun to run.  I did it in July and did not have enough water. I went through 2.5 L before I had to bust out my Life Straw flex bottle at the stream alongside the fire road and guzzled 750 ml like it was nobody's business.  All in all I drank 3.5 L. Make sure you carry enough. Saw signs for bears but thankfully no wildlife other than bees, flies, butterflies, and some random deer. Oh and another word of caution on the note of insects... be careful applying sunscreen or bug spray! I was so greased up between that and my sweat that I was slipping on the scramble. Enjoy. It is totally worth it!", "definitely a must for everyone willing to  take it on the forest, hills and super cool views", "One of my best  mountain hikes, it was adventurous trail in the first half and filled with beautiful mountain scenic spots. ", "This was my very first mountain hike ever! What a hike it was! beautiful scenery and an amazing view at the top.   The first mile was very inclined so I recommend pacing yourself. Especially if you have never done a hike like this. the trail is inclined for the most part and zig zags up the mountain side. when you approach the rock scramble be prepared for a lot of rock climbing. It then turns into more like a boulder scramble. It was an amazing experience and would do it again. \n\nI did very well throughout the hike until we hit the flat two mile walk to the parking lot. For some reason it really got me. I packed a CamelBak, cliff bars for the summit. I recommend hiking shoes or an amazing pair of tennis shoes. I wore tennis shoes, but the rocks were rough on my feet. Something I wish I had done was trim my toenails before the hike. I cracked two of them and bruised underneath one, but other than that.

The trail is cool and shaded by a canopy of trees that offers welcome relief in the summer. As you are hiking down listen to the sounds of the water and also to the sounds of nature. One of the birds that may serenade your hike is the Blue Headed Vireo. This neotropical migrant that breeds at high elevations in the park has a very sweet melodious voice that seems to say \"Look-Up, In-the-Trees\". If you happen to see a dragonfly it may be one of the uncommon species that requires pristine, shaded mountain streams. When you spot one of these you know you are in a special place.

For inexperienced hikers like me and my wife, this trail isn't moderate; though, for experienced AT hikers, it'd likely rate as moderate. Trail distance to the peak and back is about 6 miles (I recorded 5.75 miles) and took us a little under 3 hours to complete, including ~20 minutes at the top. We hiked at a decent clip because we started the trail at around 5:00 pm. It's a very up-and-down trail--roller coaster is a good term--with moderately steep inclines and declines, and one or two steeper sections, though short. Hiking shoes with stiff soles and good lugs or skid resistance for rock surfaces are advisable since most of the trail is strewn with medium-sized rocks, many with sharp edges facing up, though surprisingly we saw hikers wearing tennis shoes and Tevas. If you're inexperienced, take your time and you'll be fine. Bring ample water to stay hydrated (we had a couple of 32 oz water bottles and a 16 oz bottle), and energy snacks, especially if you have kids with you.

Late in the afternoon, Confederate reinforcements (one brigade arriving by rail from the Shenandoah Valley) extended and broke the Union right flank. The Federal retreat rapidly deteriorated into a rout. Although victorious, Confederate forces were too disorganized to pursue. Confederate Gen. Bee and Col. Bartow were killed. Thomas J. Jackson earned the nom de guerre \"Stonewall.\" By July 22, the shattered Union army reached the safety of Washington.

You won't have cell signal until you make it onto the boulder field. The hike to the base is easy going. Once you arrive at the bottom there are two routes. The boulder field is NOT PART OF THE RED OUTLINED TRAIL. Look at the trail map on here, that grey line branching off is the boulder field.\n\nGo up the boulder field or go beside it. I have done both. THE BOULDER FIELD SECTION IS IN MY TOP 5.\n\nTAKING THE TRAIL AROUND:\n\nThis trail continues beside the marble yard then turns right, away from the boulder field to go to a peak of sorts. You can follow a trail directly beside the boulder field to the top, BUT THE TRAIL IS ROUGH. The rocks are loose, the grade is steep and there is vegetation (Oak, Ivy etc). There is also no marking on this section, if you look left you clearly see the boulder field 10-15 ft away, so it does not need to be marked. Basically you are making your own trail directly beside the boulder field to make it to the top. Honestly it sucked... Just take the boulders up.\n\nCLIMBING THE BOULDER FIELD:\n\nThis is why you are here right? Cool. Now understand when you are at the base, the tree line, there are a total of three of what you see in front of you. It's ok, you've got this! The top of what you see is only the beginning. The rocks are large and there are endless ways to climb up. It seems miserable at first mostly from the heat of there being no shade. Take your time and don't rush it, grab edges and rough sections of the rocks for grip and better friction. Edges of rocks give better friction to your shoes, the smooth areas can be slick depending on your soles. If the way in front of you looks impossible then change directions, there are endless ways up. A few boulders slightly shifted on me but that was toward the top left. You are going to see hundreds of spiders. It's ok, they don't like you either so they scurry off into the depths of the rocks. Toward the upper left is a cool valley feature and slightly before that is the entrance to a opening in the rocks below. I climbed in a few feet, felt some shifting rocks and saw plenty of spiders. So I assume that is where the devil lives. I would not recommend climbing in, it's big enough for a normal sized person to squeeze in but all of the surrounding rock is loose. \n\nTIP: If you don't know your way around the area put your destination in before your hike down, while on the boulder field. It will deplete your battery but there isn't any semblance of cell signal at the trail head.

You have the option to \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d and climb up the rocks or there is a steep path along the side. There is no paint marking a path up the rocks, so you do pick your own path and may have to back track sometimes. Only encountered two loose rocks. I personally loved the scramble and the challenge it imposed. Even though the hike is shorter, I would actually say the scramble is harder than Old Rag for comparison. Lots of quad and upper body strength (especially if you are short like me!) needed. We scrambled up the rocks than came down the path (which is towards the right side when heading up). \n\nLots of big black spiders, but they were harmless and scurry away if you stepped on their rock.

All are conveniently located within a few miles of each other just outside of Roanoke.  McAfee Knob affords a 270-degree view of the Catawba Valley far below and has been called the most photographed spot along the Appalachian Trail. Just a few miles north on the AT is Tinker Cliffs, another prominent outcropping of rock offering a view of the same valley and distant mountain ranges.  A few miles southwest just inside the boundaries of Jefferson National Forest resides Dragon\u2019s Tooth, a unique geologic feature consisting of spires projecting up to 35 feet from the surrounding rock.\n\nAny of these is a worthy destination for a challenging day hike. You might be able to hit 2 of 3 on an extended day hike, but taking in all three requires an overnight stay.  The more common routes are either shuttle hikes or require lots of backtracking. This is a 3-day, 35-mile loop that circumnavigates the entire valley, hits all three viewpoints, and minimizes backtracking.  In this route, you\u2019ll hike the AT for several miles, camp at an AT shelter, cross the valley, return on the western side of the valley via the North Mountain ridge, cross the valley again, and rejoin the AT to return to your car at the Catawba Mountain parking area on Route 311.  As designed, this 35-mile loop is broken roughly into thirds. There are several parking areas, shelters and backcountry camping spots along the way, so you could divvy it up differently to suit your needs. \n\nThis trek is not recommended for beginners as this route involves lots of climbing, rock scrambles, blustery ridges and a whole day without water sources (you\u2019ll have to carry lots of water up North Mountain for Day 2).  \n\nPlease leave no trace and be mindful of trash.

We were the only ones doing counter clockwise. Everyone else went the other way.  For us, up was better than down that 1.5 mile stretch but it makes it a much harder hike. \n\nIf you do counter clockwise, do follow AllTraks to the trailhead.

You do get to walk through cow pastures twice. Super fun but I was a bit timid walking so close to them. Definitely do counter clockwise like everyone else suggested. Once you pass the Campground and start going up be prepared for a challenging climb. Once you get past mile 7 you get a straight shot for a mile or so and then you go up again. Around mile 8 we heard multiple gun shots which was quite unexpected. We were told it was probably someone having target practice. I am just happy multiple bears didn\u2019t come running our way from all the noise. One of the more challenging hikes I have done but it was so worth it.

I feel like a Dali painting - completely exhausted of any energy but this is the hardest hike I\u2019ve done to date\u2026including other VA trails.  Other folks passed us carrying no water and in regular PE clothes but the change in terrain and elevation calls for some trekking poles.  Bring more water than you\u2019ll think you need. Head counter clockwise as recommended and your best sites will push you to finish this amazing trail. This 5-star hike makes me want to modify my scoring for all previous hikes I\u2019ve rated\u2026maybe tomorrow - I need a soak and some zzzs.", "Awesome hike! Will do this again.

Able to get approximately 360 views of the valley below when walking along the ridge. Made for an incredible sun setting experience. Trail was well kept and marked.

Hike follows the creek closely along its entire course, crossing the creek multiple times and passing several scenic swimming holes, rock formations, and waterfalls.

Beyond the Bathtub, however, the trail is much less maintained and may be difficult to follow in some seasons.\n\nOvercrowding at the Devil's Bathtub has become a problem, exacerbated by hikers ignoring No Trespassing signs and parking along private property when the trailhead parking area becomes full. Please be aware that ALL areas outside of the signed parking area at the trailhead should be considered private property and should not be used for parking.

For this reason, please do not attempt the trail if the water is above your knees.", "tips": "- Getting to the Bathtub is not an easy stroll to a swimming hole - it is a difficult backcountry hike involving some skill at route-finding and multiple stream crossings. People can (and frequently do!) get lost and/or injured when they attempt to hike to the Bathtub in poor weather conditions, without enough daylight remaining, or without proper experience or preparation. In short, this is NOT a good choice for a first backcountry hike. Always hike at your own risk, and consider taking some easier hikes in the area first to become familiar with the demands of backcountry travel if you are inexperienced. Above all, be smart and come prepared when attempting this trail. If you don't know what good hiking preparation entails, it may be best to choose an easier hike.\n\n- While often easily navigated, the multiple stream crossings on this trail may require significant wading at high water and may even become treacherous during extremely high creekflow. Even at low water levels, some creek crossings are technical and cannot be made dry-shod. Use caution and good judgment before attempting any creek crossings in wet weather.\n\n- Steep terrain and heavy forest cover along this trail may prevent adequate wireless internet access and/or reduce accuracy of smartphones' GPS while on the trail. Your location on the map may therefore not be precisely accurate if tracking your progress directly on the trail.

The blue wasn't as visible because of the fast moving water.  I think the pictures were taken when the water level was lower.  Still really cool though.  \n\nI recommend turning around at the 3 forks waterfall which is a little past the bathtub.  The waterfall is really cool and there is nothing to see in the 5 remaining miles.", "I thoroughly enjoyed the hike to the bathtub. The Devil's bathtub was gorgeous  with its turquoise and clear waters and surrounding scenery. Just past the bathtub is a gorgeous waterfall too that I highly recommend.

I will say that it was a challenge to hike through the rugged terrain for 5 miles through. ", "It was a great experience for family hike. The youngest liked it so much that they said they want to go more on such hikes.  There were 10 water crossings on each side of the shortest way to the bathtub. (We took the left at the fork which had a sign indicating 1.5m to bathtub). We appreciate the intel fellow hikers gave us on their way out. We also appreciate the gentlemans\u2019 note that we were enjoying the waterhole and that the bathtub was just the other side of it. The hiking experience to the waterhole and the bathtub was awesome. The weather was superb. The rocks along either coast were picturesque. The trail itself was not hard. The only thing we could not figure out was how to get to the other side of the shore at devils bathtub. We did an out and back. It was about 5.5miles from and back to parking lot. It is a must experience trail and waterhole. Water crossings on our way back felt deeper. Water is absolutely clear and refreshing. It was totally fun. ", "Really cool hike. Loved the swimmable natural springs. Someone installed a rope where you can swing from which was perfect. Definitely leave before sunset because the valley cools quickly.

Download and you can\u2019t go wrong. Also, pretty solid camping anywhere along the loop. Just have to hunt more in some places than others. So many camp spots we\u2019d like to return to. The other great thing was the change in scenery between the AT of Wilburn Ridge and the AT around Scales. Gorgeous highland views on one and more regular firs, rhododendron, creeks and woods on the latter. Only negative, the trails flow like creeks with rain, so the trip was a bit muddy, but a small irritation compared to the beauty. The bulk of the pony herds seemed to be near Scales where we watched them play and meander from our tent in the morning. Horse droppings are plenty, so watch where you gather water and play it safe. Going clockwise sets up some climbs coming out, but manageable. Great area. Great loop(s). Can\u2019t wait to come back for other variations!", "Challenging loop especially in the mud and rain. Went in 3/28 from Lewis Fork Spur, up Mt Rogers Trail, to the Thomas Knob Shelter on AT for 7 miles total. Woke up to frozen boots and 25\u00b0.

Next time we'll start with the leftmost trailhead from the parking lot, a shortcut to the \"Slacks\" trail. The \"Slacks\" portion is just a nice walk through the woods with a couple nice views, but this time of year it really stands out thanks to the beautiful Mountain Laurels flanking both sides of the trail in dense clusters at points.

The terrain was fairly easy to hike with a few more significant slopes, step-like areas, and one stream crossing spread across the trail. Given the time of year, some of the local flora was beginning to bloom which made for a subtle yet pleasant fragrance in the air. There were a number of impressive views of the surrounding mountains. My favorite part of the hike was the creek, which I discovered could be accessed from several somewhat hidden trail spurs. Keep an eye out for these spurs because they take you down to the creek where you can see several small yet still graceful waterfalls. Some of the terrain in this area was a little more challenging and there were certainly spaces where you could risk falling, so it\u2019s probably a good idea to hike with someone else as a precaution.
